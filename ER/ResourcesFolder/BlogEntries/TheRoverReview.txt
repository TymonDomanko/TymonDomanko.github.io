Greetings to all Green & Gold readers,

The Epping Rovers have been extremely busy since the last report at the end of 2004.  Since then, we've run a very successful Region Moot (camp) and some of us attended the National Moot in Tasmania, all whilst running a full and varied programme.

Some of our programme highlights over the past few months have been rifle shooting, a Carnivale night, a number of 4WD-ing trips, a formal regressive Maccas dinner, attending the 'Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Pool Party Moot' and playing host to the Venturers at the SNR RoVenture camp.  Some of our service activities have included running a base at Dragon Skin, assisting at the Lord Mayor's Picnic (Government House) on New Year's Eve, Christmas gift wrapping for charity, and 'Hike For Hunger' food collections.

As previously mentioned we had the task of organising this year's Sydney North Region Summer Moot, which we themed 'Mullet Moot'.  Over 150 Rovers from all around the east coast of Australia braved the long and windy road down from Mittagong to Wollondilly River Station camp.   Crews from as far north as Queensland, and as far south as Victoria got into the spirit and joined the NSW Rovers for a weekend where bogans reigned supreme. Activities included a B & S ball, beverage and donut relay, re-enactments of quality daytime TV, thong toss, balloon relays, and the only wash these guys ended up having - a soapy sock wrestle.  Numerous people also drove back up the hill with new, but not necessarily improved, haircuts.

Six Rovers from our Crew were fortunate enough to get time off work over the New Year period and headed down south into the unknown to attend the 16th Australian Rover Moot in northern Tasmania, creatively dubbed 'Tassie Moot'.  Around 600 Rovers took part from all around Australia and as far afield as New Zealand, New Guinea, Canada, Switzerland and Great Britain.  Lake Barrington was the perfect site to hold the event not only because of its natural beauty but that it provided some great opportunities for onsite activities (such as water skiing, sailing and Tazmazia/pancake parlour tour) as well as a central base for offsite activities, to visit the major tourist attractions of the island State.  The main part was a five-day expedition where participants could choose one from a large list of activities such as a 'Tassie In A Rush' tour, 4Wd-ing, tall-ship sailing and white water rafting.  For everyone that was there, it was surely a highlight in their Rovering careers and something that will not easily be forgotten.

A huge congratulation goes out to Brooke Blunschi (an ex-East Ryde Rover) who has achieved the Baden-Powell Scout Award, the highest youth award in Scouting.  A lot of hard work over the years has ensured the award is well deserved!!  Her chosen activities included a study on the changes of Scouting policy in regards to religion, improving her horse riding abilities, close charity work to increase community awareness of the Eating Disorders Foundation of NSW, and further development of her piano skills.  Her award was officially presented at Government House by the Governor of NSW, and a more intimate presentation was held at East Ryde Scout Hall, both were in April.

The Crew also has some more things to be proud of.  NSW Branch has awarded us the 2004 'Quality Rovering Award' for achieving an all-round high standard of operation throughout the past year.  Not to mention at last year's Region Christmas Party, the Crew won two Region ROSCARS (Rover Oscars).  We were voted the 'Outstanding Service Activity Award' for last year's Charity Trivia Night organised to raise money for the Eating Disorders Foundation of NSW, and the 'Outstanding Rover Award' went to John Williams recognising his tireless efforts at Crew level, Region and beyond.

Coming up on our programme in the next few months we have abseiling and caving courses, Zone 3 (indoor laser skirmish), a night hike to Kissing Point, swing dancing lessons, assisting at the Region Rover Service Project, partying it up at the NSW Rover Ball, 4WD-ing camp at Hill End, and Oliver Blunschi's booting (another ex-East Ryde Rover) at Myall Lakes.

To the Venturers: we would like to thank you all for coming to ROVENTURE with us and we hope you had an awesome time.
