##ROVENTURE 2004 - Attack of the Killer Tomatoes

After a great weekend of fun and excitement a few Venturers and Rovers from around the Region had a few things to say about Roventure 2004. If you or your Venturer Unit didn't make it to Roventure this year, make sure you lookout for Roventure in February 2005.

This year's Roventure saw the Venturers and Rovers of the Region combine take and defeat the killer tomatoes while enjoying everything that 2nd Gordon Rovers and Venturers had to offer!

Camp Kariong was a great location for the weekend, with the water activities a huge success with everyone - especially Mona Vale who were the winners of the water obstacle course event, and Dean Simmat who put the activities to the test.

The events of Saturday morning were an excellent chance for each team's Venturers and Rovers to get to know each other better while completing a variety of round robin activities. Box stacking and raft building only two of many initiative activities that were on offer for each team to do their best and gain points over the weekend.
