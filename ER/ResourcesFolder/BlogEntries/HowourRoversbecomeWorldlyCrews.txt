##How our Rovers become Worldly Crews

Epping Rovers Nissa Henning and James Evans celebrating their Crew's German Carnivale night.
Epping Rovers have been enjoying the pleasures of Germany in realistic style thanks to their Rover German 'exchangee' Nina.

The Crew dressed up for a German Carnivale night which included playing German games and eating German food.

New members are always welcome to Epping Rovers and after their Carnivale night there is a special welcome to new Rovers who come from a different country so they can all have another Carnivale night.

There is a group of French Rovers visiting Sydney from August 1 and they are looking for accommodation and some Australian Rovers to show them around. Sounds like Epping Rovers may have a French Carnivale night soon?
