##So many was to help!

Brush Park, Epping and Hunters Hill Rovers have been working at Taronga Park Zoo for their regional service project.

Around 110 Rovers turned up over two days to clear garden beds, plant trees and set up irrigation systems. We are told that the Zoo staff were full of praise on a job really well done.
