##Epping Rovers log up some Hard Graft

When Sydney's Royal Easter Show closes for another year there is still a huge amount of work to be done to clear the showground.

What seemed a good idea at the time was offered to rovers. All the left over wood from the woodchopping was given to rovers. All they had to do was cut the posts into sections using chainsaws, split the resulting blocks into burnable size pieces, pack the finished product away, advertise it for sale then deliver it to buyers all over Sydney.

Many, many Saturdays and Sundays, sore arms and tired bodies later and the job is nearly done. Nine Epping Rovers were among about 36 Rovers from all over Sydney.

Each Rover Crew receives part of the proceeds according to the part of the work done by their crew. Epping will receive about $1,500 for crew funds.

And next year? There was talk on Sunday about how much lighter are lamingtons. Perhaps after a massage or two, some relaxed muscles will again long for the jarring thud of splitter hitting wood again.

One of the smart moves by Rovers at NSW Office was making sure Epping Crew were involved. Once Epping Crew is involved you know they will be there to the end.

Although with already plenty to do Epping Rovers also answered a call for help from their NSW Branch Office to control parking at the NSW Branch AGM.
