##Determined Brook takes top award

Epping Rover Brook Blunschi has celebrated after achieving her BP Award.

Five badges make up the Baden Powell award, including basic scout skills, mental, physical, social and spiritual development.

The Rover Skills badge requires several nights under canvas as well as other scouting skills such as knotting and first aid.

Brook included planting trees at Taronga Zoo, cooking a barbeque for the Joey Campfire and collecting cans of food for North Ryde Community Aid in her award.

For the remaining four badges Brook set her own goals - with the guidelines that they must be considerably challenging, and take at least six months to complete.

Brook started her first badge in 1999 with East Ryde Rovers, and after studying piano for nine months successfully achieved an A grade in an AMEB piano exam.

She then completed the rest of her challenges with Epping Rovers. For her social development badge Brook involved herself with the Eating Disorders Foundation of NSW.

As well as writing for the foundation's newsletter Brook ran a trivia night which raised over $600 for the cause. Since completion of the badge Brook has maintained her relationship with the group.

For the spiritual badge Brook put together a package to be used in Rover training on Concepts of God in Rovering. This included making a short video, a slide presentation and writing an essay based on questionnaires and research on different concepts of 'God' within the Scouting movement and particularly in Rovering.

For the physical badge Brook learnt to ride a horse well enough to compete in dressage tests. Although this included a bad fall, which fractured her spine and put Brook in hospital and unable to ride for two months (let alone walk), she persisted and continued to gain confidence and skill, completing more complex dressage movements, as well as jumping.

Congratulations Brook, from all those in Scouting.
