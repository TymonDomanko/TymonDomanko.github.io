##Kalang Kup 2006

World Cup comes to North Epping... well not quite, however it was the prestigious 2006 Kalang Kup, Sydney North Region's annual inter-Crew social soccer competition held at Wood Street Oval on Sunday June 18.

This year's event was run by Mt Colah/Mt Kuringai Rover Crew and saw six teams from around the Region (Berowra, Hunters Hill, Brush Park, Mona Vale, Kissing Point/Normanhurst and Epping) plus one out-of-Region team (Razorback) and an interstate visitor (WA) compete for the infamous trophy.

The pools were drawn up and we got stuck into it. They were grueling 14 minute games but the half-time oranges kept some of the players on their feet.

Congratulations go to Mona Vale Rover Crew who took the Kup home after narrowly defeating Brush Park in a penalty shoot-out in the finals.
