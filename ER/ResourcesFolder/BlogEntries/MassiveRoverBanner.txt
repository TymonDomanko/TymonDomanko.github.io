##Massive Rover Banner

There is a six-metre banner about rovers on the RTA's Church Street bridge at Hunters Hill until July 25. The banner faces northbound traffic coming from the Gladesville Bridge or Victoria Rd and heading up to Lane Cove. This "ROVERS DO STUFF!" banner is both accurate and may encourage new members to join.

In TWT Territory there are Rover Crews at Hunters Hill, Brush Park and Epping. All these groups do stuff.
