##Woolworths Grand Opening Barbeque

Meadowbank Scout Group and Epping Rover Crew were invited by management of the new West Ryde Woolworths shopping centre to staff the barbeques on the Sunday before the centre opened for a welcome lunch for all the new staff. It was a big hit we hear. Of course, when you want something done well you ask scouts. That's just the way it has been for a lot of years.
