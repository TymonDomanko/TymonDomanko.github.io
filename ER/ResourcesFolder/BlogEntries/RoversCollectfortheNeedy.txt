##Rover's Collect for the Needy

Rovers from the South Metropolitan Region, Greater Western Sydney Region and our own Sydney North Region have collected around 7,500 food items of food for their annual Hike for Hunger.
The food was delivered to Wesley Mission where it was sorted and packed. Some Rovers hiked with a quantity of the food from Milson's Point across the Harbour Bridge and up to the Mission in Pitt Street.
Brush Park, Epping and Hunters Hill Rovers in TWT territory all collected food so others will have a brighter Christmas.

Rovers are busy collecting non-perishable foods for their Hike For Hunger.  The food is distributed to those in need by the Wesley Mission.  TWT Rover Groups are at Brush Park, Epping and Hunters Hill.  They are strong young people so give them plenty to carry.
