##Bush dance 2005

Epping Rovers have continued with their busy active program this time attending an annual Bush Dance put on by Castle Hill rover crew. Publicity for the bush dance included it's the time of year to grab your pitch forks, pull out the flannies and square dance with your favourite cousin. Sounds like Rovers to me.
