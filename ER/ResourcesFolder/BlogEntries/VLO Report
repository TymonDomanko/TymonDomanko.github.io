So there hasn't been any activities with the Venturer's since the AGM.
Although There wasn't many events held the VLO's have surveyed the Venturers about what they would like to see again/what they would like us to run.
The Venturers Enjoyed The Trivia Night, The Movie Night, Hanging Soccer and Freaky Friday; so these will likely be seen again.
They also Said that they would like to see Competitive nights, Competeing in Construction activities and/or Sports wide games such as Spotlight and/or a Cork skirmish etc.. 

Next week we will also be looking for people who will run some of those nights.
We will also be implementing a new stratergy at the planning night next week where we will mark nights that are good for venturers to come along. The VLO's will arrange for them to be invited or go and personally invite them, this is to try and accustomise the venturers to what we actually do instead of how we run nights solely for them. This will be run along side the Current Rover Venture nights. 

There are lots of venturers turning 18 in the next year 2 from Epping and 11 from Beecroft and apparently none from Moocooboolah.
