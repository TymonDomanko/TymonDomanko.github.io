<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/CampKu-ring-gai.jpg" alt="Camp Ku-ring-gai" /></p>
<p>Every year on the third weekend in May, the Rovers of the Region take on a major service project, alternating between giving service to the community and to a Scouting cause.</p>
<p>This May, the project took place at Camp Ku-ring-gai on the Hawkesbury River at Lower Portland. Despite threatening weather, the Saturday saw around 40 Rovers get going on a range of tasks including building steps and paths, burning rubbish, removing trees and stumps, fixing tables and clearing lantana.</p>
<p>Over lunch, a screening of the recent ABC-TV &quot;Australian Story&quot; episode about Dick Smith and his old Rover mates returning to Ball's Pyramid provided a good opportunity to have a break and boost morale!</p>
<p>Crews who attended on the Saturday included Epping, Kissing Point, Turramurra, Gordon, Forest, Garigal and Mona Vale. Most Crews finished their tasks, but those who didn't gave assurances they'd be back to finish their job in coming weeks.</p>
<p>The weather on the Sunday continued to hold up as Rovers from Hunters Hill, Normanhurst, Brush Park and Platabeen all chipped in to do their bit. The guys from Brush Park seemed to have no trouble fixing up the guttering, whilst the Platabeen tilers probably struggled a bit more. Normanhurst had trouble getting their heads around the method used to clean the wooden floor, which consisted of pouring sawdust all over it - but they figured it out eventually.</p>
<p>With 32 Rovers all up on Sunday, there was plenty of lunch to go around. The weekend seemed pretty successful, and the camp co-ordinator, John Tibbitts, was thoroughly impressed with everyone's efforts. Well done!</p>

<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/MaxineMcKew-2.jpg" alt="Maxine McKew 2" /></p>
<p>Bennelong MP Maxine McKew congratulated some local Scouts and Rovers last week- including Peter Favelle, Lauren Tubby and Scott Osborne- on receiving more than four thousand dollars from the Australian Government's 2008 Volunteer Grants Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Scouts and Rovers do so much work in our local community. This funding will enable volunteers working with the Scouts and Rovers to do even more to help those in need,&quot; she said. 21-year-old Rover Pete Favelle said the funding from the grant would pay for useful equipment like a marquee, tents, heaters, IT equipment, and gardening equipment.</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/MaxineMcKew-3.jpg" alt="Maxine McKew 3" /></p>
<p>Twelve volunteer organisations in Bennelong will receive a total of $32130 in funding from the Federal Government's 2008 Volunteer Grants Program... &quot;Every day volunteers are out in their local communities working tirelessly to help the elderly, sick and those who have hit hard times,&quot; Ms McKew said. &quot;The Government values the enormous contibution volunteers make in our community and this funding will ease the financial pressure on non-profit organisations and their volunteers.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Mckew met a group of Scouts and Rovers to congratulate them on receiving more then $4000 through the grants program. The money will be used to purchase tents, heaters, IT equipment and gardening supplies.</p>
<p>Among the group was 21 year old Pete Favelle who, as a 1st Epping Rover, has been helping to train other Scouts. He said his group would buy useful equipment like a marquee, which, in turn, allowed the rovers to better serve the community.</p>

<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/90th-birthday.jpg" alt="90th Birthday" /></p>
<p>Epping Scout Group has celebrated its 90th Anniversary having been founded in 1915, with the first group leader being William Hunt. Since 1915 the group has only had seven group leaders - this dedication and commitment by leaders is one of the reasons for the group thriving through the years.</p>
<p>Over 60 group members have achieved the distinction of Queen’s or King’s Scout.</p>
<p>Epping group is blessed with halls in Epping and North Epping, and a boatshed on the Parramatta River at Meadowbank.</p>
<p>The group presently has 60 boys and girls as members spread through all scout sections - Joeys, cubs, scouts, venturers and rovers.</p>
<p>Epping’s 90th Anniversary celebration was attended by some 70 people representing over 80 years of scouting, with the oldest association being Frank Jacobs who joined cubs in 1930 aged 8.</p>
<p>Nine long-serving leaders in the group received awards.</p>

<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/jwilliams_stanbales.jpg" alt="John Williams Stan Bales" /></p>
<p>John Williams, until recently a member of Epping Rover Crew, was presented with the prestigious Stan Bales Rover Service Award on April 2nd. This award has only been presented 22 times since its inception in New South Wales in 1986, and is given to outstanding individuals who have made a major contribution to the Rover Section over and above what would usually be expected within their normal role.</p>
<p>John is the second person from the Epping Rover Crew to ever be honoured in such a way and only the sixth awardee to come from Sydney North. This award recognises the major role John has had at all levels of NSW Rovering including two terms as Crew Leader of Epping Rover Crew in 2002 and 2003, two terms as Chairman of the Sydney North Region Rover Council (RRC) in 2003 and 2004, and Vice-President of the NSW Branch Rover Council (BRC) in 2005.</p>
<p>The Stan Bales Rover Service Award is awarded by the NSW Branch Rover Council on recommendation of the Rover's peers. The Award is named in honour of the late Stan Bales, who was NSW Branch Commissioner for Rovers for 28 years and was known affectionately as &quot;Mr Rovering&quot;.</p>
<p>John Williams first started in Scouting as a Cub at 1st Epping Group in 1988. In addition to holding the positions mentioned above, during his Rovering career he has been co-ordinator of several service and fundraising projects at Crew, Region and Branch levels, was a member of YACS (Youth Advisory Committee on Scouting) for two years, has presented at numerous Rover and Venturer training courses, facilitated a treasurers’ course for Sydney North Region Rovers, assisted with running various major Rover activities including Moots, Roventure and the NSW Rover Ball.</p>
<p>On reaching the age of 26, John was recently farewelled from Rovering by his Crew, however he continues to have involvement with the section, currently holding the role of Activities Team Leader for the forthcoming 17th Australian Rover Moot - &quot;Aussie Moot&quot;.</p>
<p>John Williams has given exemplary and outstanding service to the Rover section in NSW, giving freely of his time and always being willing to use his skills to the benefit of others. He truly displays the Rover spirit of adventure and service and is a more than worthy recipient of the Stan Bales Rover Service Award. Congratulations John!</p>

<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/flyingfox04.jpg" alt="FlyingFox" /></p>
<p>Potential Joeys and Cubs lined up all day to experience the thrills of the Flying Fox at the Roselea School Fete held on September 18th.</p>
<p>The 1st Roselea Group decided to run the day both as community service and to raise our profile in our main local feeder school. We used leaflets and stickers from NSW Branch publicity pack (available to all Groups).</p>
<p>As the children lined up for the experience, parents made lots of enquiries regarding Scouting before some of the mums lined up as well. We have 7 families interested in Cubs/Scouts and 10 who may form the core of a new Joey Mob.</p>
<p>Sydney North Region Office lent us their enormous yellow &quot;Scouts&quot; banner and some promotional laminated posters, which we used to identify the area.</p>
<p>It was really a team effort: the Sydney North Flying Fox Team led by David &quot;Chips&quot; Rafferty, a great bunch of Epping Rovers, Cub and Scout Leaders, Cubs and Scouts in uniform and parents all worked hard together to provide around 500 rides on the day.</p>
<p>Cost was a gold coin donation for 2 rides, this was to help with the replacement of ropes, etc. &quot;Cubs and Scouts who turned up in uniform got free rides,&quot; so we had lots of uniformed members at the fete: great publicity!</p>
<p>Set-up was on Friday afternoon and evening, from approximately 4:30 to 10:30pm, then the Rovers had pizza and slept at the school to provide security. Final adjustments, safety checks, harnessing teams instructed at 7:30am and we were up and running by 9:30... hard work but great fun. Finished at 3pm and packed up by 4:30pm. The rovers had been there for 24 hours! Bravo to all!</p>
<p>Overall it was a fantastic day. The food stalls were great as well, especially the Devonshire teas! The School has told us we were very popular and has said we would be welcome back. It was very good for Group morale, great publicity and we gave a lot of children big smiles!</p>
<p>Thanks again to the Flying Fox Team and Epping Rovers.</p>

<p>Epping and Brush Park Rovers along with their Car “Black Betty” have returned from a road trip to compete in the annual Rover Motorsports event held in Yea, Victoria.<br />
Mudbash is an annual Rover Motorsports event run in Victoria each year on a 130 hectare property called Mafeking Rover Park. Events run from sunrise to well into the night right across the property. With time trials, 4WD events, an obstacle course and even car vs car tug-of-war in the main arena there is something for everyone.</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/Mudbash20101.jpg" alt="Mudbash2010 1" /></p>
<p>Black Betty and her Crew from Brush Park were successful, placing in many of the events over the weekend. Matt Rath, one of the drivers of Black Betty said: “Mudbash yet again didn’t disappoint, with the rain holding off for some awesome fun on the rally tracks. Minor technical problems didn’t hold us back. The car came home running and in one piece for the first time in three years so it definitely was a success. Close to 100 Rovers from NSW made the journey across the border with 5 from Epping and 4 from Brush Park. We even had time to stop along the way, visiting the submarine HMAS Otway in the historic town of Holbrook. We also enjoyed the “serenity” at Bonne Doon, a small town in Victoria made famous by the movie The Castle.”</p>

<p>Epping Rovers John, James, Nissa, Jordan, Brook and Oliver at Tassie Moot. Rovers go to Moots - that’s one of the facts in scouting. They are 18 years and older and in TWT territory there are Rover Crews at Epping, Brush Park and Hunters Hill. Other things about Moots like lack of sleep may be just stories rather than facts. You can check this out with your local Rover Crew. Epping Rovers are organising the Sydney North Region’s Summer Moot which is being held in March. As part of their training a number of Epping Rover Crew went to the National Moot held in Tasmania. How was it? According to John Williams “Tassie Moot was an awesome event packed full of adventure and challenges, fun and laughs while meeting so many fantastic people from around Australia and the world. All of these great experiences were made possible through Rovers.”</p>

<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/hikeforhunger02b.jpg" alt="hikeforhunger02b" /></p>
<p>Over 150 Rovers from all over NSW participated with this years NSW Rovers Annual Service Project, Hike for Hunger, by collecting canned and non-perishable goods for The Wesley Mission, Sydney.</p>
<p>Hike for Hunger is a state-wide project that Rovers actively participate in, in conjunction with the Wesley Mission's Homeless Kids Outreach Program. Rovers had been collecting canned and non-perishable foods from everywhere and anywhere. They were in shopping centres and on the streets, talking to people about the excellent work that The Wesley Mission does for the underprivileged in Sydney, but also the great work that Rovers does in the community, and that they live up to their motto of &quot;Service&quot;.</p>
<p>This years hike took place in Sydney, on Saturday, 19th October, 2002, with Rovers from across the State walking across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and then through Sydney to the offices of The Wesley Mission, where all the food was presented. Over 4,000 cans were collected in all, and it yet again overfilled the cupboards at the centre!!!!!!</p>
<p>This is the fourth year that NSW Rovers have stepped up to the challenge, and participated in the Hike for Hunger project. It aims to promote the awareness of the needs of homeless and underprivileged people in Sydney, in particular youth at risk. It also acts as a way for collecting much needed food for this worthwhile cause.</p>

<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/timor_team.jpg" alt="timor_team" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of July, five Australian Rovers participated in the Timor-Leste project, a co-operation between Scouts Australia and Rotary Australia.</p>
<p>The Timor-Leste project aims to improve health and sanitation in East Timor. Chris Malam from ACT, Nicky Strachan from Victoria, Brandon Leaning from Queensland, Delshard Mozhdehinia from WA and our very own Lauren Tubby, along with Graeme Fordham from Scouts Australia and two NSW Rotarians, Jo and John, spent 11 days at Amutin Primary School in Dili, building a new toilet block and refurbishing other parts of the school.</p>
<p>Currently, Amutin Primary School is attended by 1,200 students, 20 teachers, and has only four toilets. As part of the Timor-Leste project, the Rovers worked with the local Timor-Leste Rovers and Rotaract Youth to paint the existing toilet block, and almost the entire school, insulate the small school kitchen and assist with laying the foundations for the new toilet block. Local builders were hired for the major construction work required during the project.</p>
<p>The Timor-Leste project was funded by “Dollars for Dili,” and ACT Government initiative, and the Rotary Club of South Dubbo. “It was a fantastic project - to be able to work with locals our age, to help even just a small community and to experience the country and culture. It’s a great project with memories to last forever,” said Lauren. The Timor-Leste project is planned to be an ongoing service project for Rovers, Scouts Australia and Rotary. Find out more about the project on the Scouts Australia website here and here.</p>

<p>Over the weekend of March 11-13, over 175 Rovers from all around the east coast of Australia hitched up their wagons and travelled up to Camp Kanangra on Lake Macquarie to “have a buckin’ good time” at Western Moot with 1st Epping Rovers for Sydney North Region’s Annual Summer Moot.</p>
<p>Crews from all over NSW, a few well travelled Queenslanders and even two Rovers from the nation’s capital, had a great time competing in the Cowboy 101 Pentathlon, tossing horse shoes, playing hangman, sending smoke signals and building tepees. There was even a showdown at high noon, fortunately no Rovers were harmed in the shoot out.</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/2012SummerMoot1.jpg" alt="2012SummerMoot1" /></p>

<p>Impressive fake moustaches, cowboy hats and stylish leather chaps won Kings Langley Rovers the award of “Best Dressed” crew while Turramurra Rovers were victorious over the course of the weekend, despite their ludicrous rainbow cowboy hats. As well as the glory of winning, Turramurra took home a genuine saddle signed by all the participants, which will look great hanging in their den.</p>
