<h2>Rovers race from the Rock</h2>
<p>Four Rover Scouts have just returned from an epic journey from the centre of Australia to Sydney in under 30 hours non-stop!</p>
<p>1st Epping Rover Crew members Anthony Buckley, Peter Favelle, Mark Gurd and Scott Osborne decided to put the 'out' in Scouting one weekend and planned a race from Ayers Rock to Sydney, a distance of 2919km, with the aim of finishing in less than 30 hours.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounded like a great adventure when I first heard about it&quot; commented Anthony.</p>
<p>21 year old Anthony went on to say &quot;the country we covered was varied and diverse in so many ways from the red earth of Ayers Rock and the Olgas to the flat Hay Plains. It was such a shame we were racing against the clock.&quot;</p>
<p>The four Rovers took turns in driving and their entire journey was captured on video and is being produced into a promotional video and to enter &quot;Rovering's Greatest Adventure&quot;, a competition with a cash prize aimed at encouraging the 18 to 26 year old Rovers to go on an adventure they will remember for life.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the things we did will be on that video and I think you will be surprised how many different things can be done to keep awake in a car for a day and a half&quot; said Mark.</p>

<h2>Stroud Weekend Report by Emma</h2>
<p>1st Epping Rover Crew had a productive and enjoyable weekend servicing the site of Stroud Monastery on the weekend of the 14 of September. We helped out by completely clearing the roof and gutters from one of the main buildings on site in addition to the smaller hobbit house.</p>
<p>The crew also assisted in the creation of an outdoor chapel and the removal of an unused, rotting ramp.<br />
Overall it was a great and busy weekend that everyone who attended enjoyed thoroughly and we are all excited to go up again!</p>

<p>On the afternoon of 11th March 2012 the Crew got together to celebrate the massive achievement by Jordan Hodgson to complete and be awarded both his Baden-Powell Scout Award (BPSA) and his Woodbadge for Venturers Section.<br />
The Baden-Powell Scout Award is the highest Scouting award available to Youth in Australia. This Award is designed to challenge and test all who set out to achieve this prestigious Award. It takes into consideration the Aims of Scouting, to encourage the Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, Social and Spiritual Development of young people.</p>
<p>Jordan will visit Government house in a few weeks to be presented the award by the Chief Scout of NSW (The Governor Marie Basheer)</p></div></div></div><div class="post-out 4 hideable hidden"><div class="post"><div class="content"><h5>31-01-2012</h5>
<h2>The Timor-Leste Project</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/timor_team.jpg" alt="timor_team" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of July, five Australian Rovers participated in the Timor-Leste project, a co-operation between Scouts Australia and Rotary Australia.</p>
<p>The Timor-Leste project aims to improve health and sanitation in East Timor. Chris Malam from ACT, Nicky Strachan from Victoria, Brandon Leaning from Queensland, Delshard Mozhdehinia from WA and our very own Lauren Tubby, along with Graeme Fordham from Scouts Australia and two NSW Rotarians, Jo and John, spent 11 days at Amutin Primary School in Dili, building a new toilet block and refurbishing other parts of the school.</p>
<p>Currently, Amutin Primary School is attended by 1,200 students, 20 teachers, and has only four toilets. As part of the Timor-Leste project, the Rovers worked with the local Timor-Leste Rovers and Rotaract Youth to paint the existing toilet block, and almost the entire school, insulate the small school kitchen and assist with laying the foundations for the new toilet block. Local builders were hired for the major construction work required during the project.</p>
<p>The Timor-Leste project was funded by “Dollars for Dili,” and ACT Government initiative, and the Rotary Club of South Dubbo. “It was a fantastic project - to be able to work with locals our age, to help even just a small community and to experience the country and culture. It’s a great project with memories to last forever,” said Lauren. The Timor-Leste project is planned to be an ongoing service project for Rovers, Scouts Australia and Rotary. Find out more about the project on the Scouts Australia website here and here.</p>

<h2>Summer Moot 2011</h2>
<p>Over the weekend of March 11-13, over 175 Rovers from all around the east coast of Australia hitched up their wagons and travelled up to Camp Kanangra on Lake Macquarie to “have a buckin’ good time” at Western Moot with 1st Epping Rovers for Sydney North Region’s Annual Summer Moot.</p>
<p>Crews from all over NSW, a few well travelled Queenslanders and even two Rovers from the nation’s capital, had a great time competing in the Cowboy 101 Pentathlon, tossing horse shoes, playing hangman, sending smoke signals and building tepees. There was even a showdown at high noon, fortunately no Rovers were harmed in the shoot out.</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/2012SummerMoot1.jpg" alt="2012SummerMoot1" /></p>
<p>Saturday night dinner was an authentic Western Style stew and diners were treated to the debut performance of the Tiny Dinosaurs Country &amp; Western band - featuring two members of 1st Epping Rovers playing a variety of guitars, banjos, harmonicas and even a ukulele!</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/2012SummerMoot2.jpg" alt="2012SummerMoot2" /></p>
<p>Impressive fake moustaches, cowboy hats and stylish leather chaps won Kings Langley Rovers the award of “Best Dressed” crew while Turramurra Rovers were victorious over the course of the weekend, despite their ludicrous rainbow cowboy hats. As well as the glory of winning, Turramurra took home a genuine saddle signed by all the participants, which will look great hanging in their den.</p>

<h2>Rovers have a blast at Mudbash</h2>
<p>Epping and Brush Park Rovers along with their Car “Black Betty” have returned from a road trip to compete in the annual Rover Motorsports event held in Yea, Victoria.<br />
Mudbash is an annual Rover Motorsports event run in Victoria each year on a 130 hectare property called Mafeking Rover Park. Events run from sunrise to well into the night right across the property. With time trials, 4WD events, an obstacle course and even car vs car tug-of-war in the main arena there is something for everyone.</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/mudbash20101.jpg" alt="Mudbash2010 1" /></p>
<p>Black Betty and her Crew from Brush Park were successful, placing in many of the events over the weekend. Matt Rath, one of the drivers of Black Betty said: “Mudbash yet again didn’t disappoint, with the rain holding off for some awesome fun on the rally tracks. Minor technical problems didn’t hold us back. The car came home running and in one piece for the first time in three years so it definitely was a success. Close to 100 Rovers from NSW made the journey across the border with 5 from Epping and 4 from Brush Park. We even had time to stop along the way, visiting the submarine HMAS Otway in the historic town of Holbrook. We also enjoyed the “serenity” at Bonne Doon, a small town in Victoria made famous by the movie The Castle.”</p>

<p>Epping Scout Group celebrated winning the Sirius Cup for sailing and water activities at last week's Group Open Day and Annual General Meeting at the Ray Lawrence Boatshed on the Parramatta River next to Meadowbank Wharf.</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/OpenDay-2.jpg" alt="Open Day 2" /></p>
<p>Over 1000 scouts competed at the annual Sirius Regatta at Balmoral, which Epping last won in 1978. Previously they had won in 1951 and 1972. Ryde Mayor Clr Vic Tagg presented the Cup to competitiors Jack Bewsher and Chris Mitchell with Epping Boat Activities Leader Merv Turner. 1st Epping Rovers are on the ten-seater bike which 1st Putney Rovers built and rode to Melbourne some years ago to enter the Guiness Book of Records.</p>

<h2>Hanging Around with Maxine McKew</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/MaxineMcKew-2.jpg" alt="Maxine McKew 2" /></p>
<p>Bennelong MP Maxine McKew congratulated some local Scouts and Rovers last week- including Peter Favelle, Lauren Tubby and Scott Osborne- on receiving more than four thousand dollars from the Australian Government's 2008 Volunteer Grants Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Scouts and Rovers do so much work in our local community. This funding will enable volunteers working with the Scouts and Rovers to do even more to help those in need,&quot; she said. 21-year-old Rover Pete Favelle said the funding from the grant would pay for useful equipment like a marquee, tents, heaters, IT equipment, and gardening equipment.</p>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/MaxineMcKew-3.jpg" alt="Maxine McKew 3" /></p>
<p>Twelve volunteer organisations in Bennelong will receive a total of $32130 in funding from the Federal Government's 2008 Volunteer Grants Program... &quot;Every day volunteers are out in their local communities working tirelessly to help the elderly, sick and those who have hit hard times,&quot; Ms McKew said. &quot;The Government values the enormous contibution volunteers make in our community and this funding will ease the financial pressure on non-profit organisations and their volunteers.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Mckew met a group of Scouts and Rovers to congratulate them on receiving more then $4000 through the grants program. The money will be used to purchase tents, heaters, IT equipment and gardening supplies.</p>
<p>Among the group was 21 year old Pete Favelle who, as a 1st Epping Rover, has been helping to train other Scouts. He said his group would buy useful equipment like a marquee, which, in turn, allowed the rovers to better serve the community.</p>

<h2>Rovers get stuck into Stucco</h2>
<p>Scouting and Guiding includes the opportunity and training to be of service to others.</p>
<p>And scouting's Sydney North Region Rovers, which include TWT territories Brush Park and Epping Rover Crews, have just completed their annual joint Sydney North Region Rover Service project - to help out the Wesley Mission at their Mangrove Mountain Retreat.</p>
<p>Work started early on the Saturday, setting to work on building a children's playground and on removing old stucco off one of the lodges in preparation for recladding, digging trenches for water run-off, and cutting a bush track and laying mulch on a landscape garden.</p>
<p>Sunday was our turn. Brush Park Rover's set to work on recladding the lodge and Epping Rovers helped to finish the building of the playground and also assisted with the recladding of the lodge.</p>
<p>By Sunday afternoon Rovers of Sydney North really had something to show for their efforts and Wesley Mission was more than ecstatic with our Rovers' efforts and grateful that they had been able to assist them make the retreat a better place for disadvantaged youth and families.</p>

<h2>Kalang Kup 2006</h2>
<p>World Cup comes to North Epping... well not quite, however it was the prestigious 2006 Kalang Kup, Sydney North Region's annual inter-Crew social soccer competition held at Wood Street Oval on Sunday June 18.</p>
<p>This year's event was run by Mt Colah/Mt Kuringai Rover Crew and saw six teams from around the Region (Berowra, Hunters Hill, Brush Park, Mona Vale, Kissing Point/Normanhurst and Epping) plus one out-of-Region team (Razorback) and an interstate visitor (WA) compete for the infamous trophy.</p>
<p>The pools were drawn up and we got stuck into it. They were grueling 14 minute games but the half-time oranges kept some of the players on their feet.</p>
<p>Congratulations go to Mona Vale Rover Crew who took the Kup home after narrowly defeating Brush Park in a penalty shoot-out in the finals.</p>

<h2>1st Epping Scout Group Turns 90</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/90th-birthday.jpg" alt="90th Birthday" /></p>
<p>Epping Scout Group has celebrated its 90th Anniversary having been founded in 1915, with the first group leader being William Hunt. Since 1915 the group has only had seven group leaders - this dedication and commitment by leaders is one of the reasons for the group thriving through the years.</p>
<p>Over 60 group members have achieved the distinction of Queen’s or King’s Scout.</p>
<p>Epping group is blessed with halls in Epping and North Epping, and a boatshed on the Parramatta River at Meadowbank.</p>
<p>The group presently has 60 boys and girls as members spread through all scout sections - Joeys, cubs, scouts, venturers and rovers.</p>
<p>Epping’s 90th Anniversary celebration was attended by some 70 people representing over 80 years of scouting, with the oldest association being Frank Jacobs who joined cubs in 1930 aged 8.</p>
<p>Nine long-serving leaders in the group received awards.</p>

<h2>It's all go for young and old</h2>
<p>One of the great things about scouting is you can get involved at almost any age.</p>
<p>Rovers is the senior section for those aged 18 to 25 years old. Rovers run their own activities and in TWT territory there are three active Rover Crews at Brush Park, Epping and Hunters Hill. Crews meet one night each week, but this is only the beginning of the busy life which is rovers.</p>
<p>All our groups are participating in the annual Rover's Hike for Hunger. Crews have been collecting canned food for the Wesley Mission to provide to families in need.</p>
<p>On Saturday Olympic Park at Homebush will be awash with rovers as well as all the food they have collected which will be transported to Wesley's store. In previous years the food has been carried across the Harbour Bridge, thus the name Hike for Hunger, but as rovers collect more and more food the delivery system has had to be changed. In typical rover style the day will include a barbeque and lots of socialising.</p>
<p>If you join one of the local Rover Crews between now and Christmas you could go swing dancing, play Pictionary, camp at Myall Lake or go four-wheel driving at Stockton.</p>
<p>There will be cooking nights, movie nights and games nights, and this is just in the planned activities. Being a rover seems to also include endless barbeques and parties. It is never too late to join in scouting.</p>

As one rover said, 'The only sad part about the Hike for Hunger is that there are people who need help just to feed themselves and their families.'

<h2>Woolworths Grand Opening Barbeque</h2>
<p>Meadowbank Scout Group and Epping Rover Crew were invited by management of the new West Ryde Woolworths shopping centre to staff the barbeques on the Sunday before the centre opened for a welcome lunch for all the new staff.

<h2>Rovers pitch in at Camp Ku-ring-gai</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/CampKu-ring-gai.jpg" alt="Camp Ku-ring-gai" /></p>
<p>Every year on the third weekend in May, the Rovers of the Region take on a major service project, alternating between giving service to the community and to a Scouting cause.</p>
<p>This May, the project took place at Camp Ku-ring-gai on the Hawkesbury River at Lower Portland. Despite threatening weather, the Saturday saw around 40 Rovers get going on a range of tasks including building steps and paths, burning rubbish, removing trees and stumps, fixing tables and clearing lantana.</p>
<p>Over lunch, a screening of the recent ABC-TV &quot;Australian Story&quot; episode about Dick Smith and his old Rover mates returning to Ball's Pyramid provided a good opportunity to have a break and boost morale!</p>
<p>Crews who attended on the Saturday included Epping, Kissing Point, Turramurra, Gordon, Forest, Garigal and Mona Vale. Most Crews finished their tasks, but those who didn't gave assurances they'd be back to finish their job in coming weeks.</p>
<p>The weather on the Sunday continued to hold up as Rovers from Hunters Hill, Normanhurst, Brush Park and Platabeen all chipped in to do their bit. The guys from Brush Park seemed to have no trouble fixing up the guttering, whilst the Platabeen tilers probably struggled a bit more. Normanhurst had trouble getting their heads around the method used to clean the wooden floor, which consisted of pouring sawdust all over it - but they figured it out eventually.</p>
<p>With 32 Rovers all up on Sunday, there was plenty of lunch to go around. The weekend seemed pretty successful, and the camp co-ordinator, John Tibbitts, was thoroughly impressed with everyone's efforts. Well done!</p>

<h2>Rovers get track action in the bush</h2>

<p>Epping Rovers on a day's four-wheel driving.</p>
<p>Epping Rovers are certainly a fun group to be in.</p>
<p>As well as service activities, fundraising for charities, and lots of camping, which with lots of practice would probably now be termed 'camping in style', the group also spends many days driving their 4WD vehicles while testing the limits of both vehicles and some very rough tracks.</p>
<p>A lot of fun but always with proper care being taken. Good exercise with the digging out and towing out which can fill quite a large part of a day out.</p>

<h2>The Rover Review</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/gg05tassie.jpg" alt="The Rover Review" /></p>
<p>John, James, Nissa and Jordan</p>
<p>Pebbly Beach, Tasmania</p>
<p>Greetings to all Green &amp; Gold readers,</p>
<p>The Epping Rovers have been extremely busy since the last report at the end of 2004.  Since then, we've run a very successful Region Moot (camp) and some of us attended the National Moot in Tasmania, all whilst running a full and varied programme.</p>
<p>Some of our programme highlights over the past few months have been rifle shooting, a Carnivale night, a number of 4WD-ing trips, a formal regressive Maccas dinner, attending the 'Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Pool Party Moot' and playing host to the Venturers at the SNR RoVenture camp.  Some of our service activities have included running a base at Dragon Skin, assisting at the Lord Mayor's Picnic (Government House) on New Year's Eve, Christmas gift wrapping for charity, and 'Hike For Hunger' food collections.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned we had the task of organising this year's Sydney North Region Summer Moot, which we themed 'Mullet Moot'.  Over 150 Rovers from all around the east coast of Australia braved the long and windy road down from Mittagong to Wollondilly River Station camp.   Crews from as far north as Queensland, and as far south as Victoria got into the spirit and joined the NSW Rovers for a weekend where bogans reigned supreme. Activities included a B &amp; S ball, beverage and donut relay, re-enactments of quality daytime TV, thong toss, balloon relays, and the only wash these guys ended up having - a soapy sock wrestle.  Numerous people also drove back up the hill with new, but not necessarily improved, haircuts.</p>
<p>Six Rovers from our Crew were fortunate enough to get time off work over the New Year period and headed down south into the unknown to attend the 16th Australian Rover Moot in northern Tasmania, creatively dubbed 'Tassie Moot'.  Around 600 Rovers took part from all around Australia and as far afield as New Zealand, New Guinea, Canada, Switzerland and Great Britain.  Lake Barrington was the perfect site to hold the event not only because of its natural beauty but that it provided some great opportunities for onsite activities (such as water skiing, sailing and Tazmazia/pancake parlour tour) as well as a central base for offsite activities, to visit the major tourist attractions of the island State.  The main part was a five-day expedition where participants could choose one from a large list of activities such as a 'Tassie In A Rush' tour, 4Wd-ing, tall-ship sailing and white water rafting.  For everyone that was there, it was surely a highlight in their Rovering careers and something that will not easily be forgotten.</p>
<p>A huge congratulation goes out to Brooke Blunschi (an ex-East Ryde Rover) who has achieved the Baden-Powell Scout Award, the highest youth award in Scouting.  A lot of hard work over the years has ensured the award is well deserved!!  Her chosen activities included a study on the changes of Scouting policy in regards to religion, improving her horse riding abilities, close charity work to increase community awareness of the Eating Disorders Foundation of NSW, and further development of her piano skills.  Her award was officially presented at Government House by the Governor of NSW, and a more intimate presentation was held at East Ryde Scout Hall, both were in April.</p>
<p>The Crew also has some more things to be proud of.  NSW Branch has awarded us the 2004 'Quality Rovering Award' for achieving an all-round high standard of operation throughout the past year.  Not to mention at last year's Region Christmas Party, the Crew won two Region ROSCARS (Rover Oscars).  We were voted the 'Outstanding Service Activity Award' for last year's Charity Trivia Night organised to raise money for the Eating Disorders Foundation of NSW, and the 'Outstanding Rover Award' went to John Williams recognising his tireless efforts at Crew level, Region and beyond.</p>
<p>Coming up on our programme in the next few months we have abseiling and caving courses, Zone 3 (indoor laser skirmish), a night hike to Kissing Point, swing dancing lessons, assisting at the Region Rover Service Project, partying it up at the NSW Rover Ball, 4WD-ing camp at Hill End, and Oliver Blunschi's booting (another ex-East Ryde Rover) at Myall Lakes.</p>
<p>To the Venturers: we would like to thank you all for coming to ROVENTURE with us and we hope you had an awesome time.</p>

<h2>Determined Brook takes top award</h2>
<p>Epping Rover Brook Blunschi has celebrated after achieving her BP Award.</p>
<p>Five badges make up the Baden Powell award, including basic scout skills, mental, physical, social and spiritual development.</p>
<p>The Rover Skills badge requires several nights under canvas as well as other scouting skills such as knotting and first aid.</p>
<p>Brook included planting trees at Taronga Zoo, cooking a barbeque for the Joey Campfire and collecting cans of food for North Ryde Community Aid in her award.</p>
<p>For the remaining four badges Brook set her own goals - with the guidelines that they must be considerably challenging, and take at least six months to complete.</p>
<hr />
<p>Brook started her first badge in 1999 with East Ryde Rovers, and after studying piano for nine months successfully achieved an A grade in an AMEB piano exam.</p>
<p>She then completed the rest of her challenges with Epping Rovers. For her social development badge Brook involved herself with the Eating Disorders Foundation of NSW.</p>
<p>As well as writing for the foundation's newsletter Brook ran a trivia night which raised over $600 for the cause. Since completion of the badge Brook has maintained her relationship with the group.</p>
<p>For the spiritual badge Brook put together a package to be used in Rover training on Concepts of God in Rovering. This included making a short video, a slide presentation and writing an essay based on questionnaires and research on different concepts of 'God' within the Scouting movement and particularly in Rovering.</p>
<p>For the physical badge Brook learnt to ride a horse well enough to compete in dressage tests. Although this included a bad fall, which fractured her spine and put Brook in hospital and unable to ride for two months (let alone walk), she persisted and continued to gain confidence and skill, completing more complex dressage movements, as well as jumping.</p>
<p>Congratulations Brook, from all those in Scouting.</p>

<h2>Epping Rover Crew's 'The Moot'</h2>
<p>The biggest annual Sydney North Region Rover event is the Rover's Moot which has this year been organised by our own Epping Rover Crew.</p>
<p>Over 150 Rovers from all around the east coast of Australia and including even crews from as far north as Queensland, and as far south as Victoria, braved the long and windy road down from Mittagong to Wollondilly River Station to join Epping Rovers for this wonderful Moot.</p>
<p>Activities included a B &amp; S ball, beer and donut relay, re-enactments of quality daytime TV, thong tossing, finding lost cans, balloon relays, and the only wash these guys get during the moot - a soapy wrestle.</p>
<p>Numerous people also drove back up the hill with new, but not necessarily improved, haircuts.</p>
<p>Forest Rover Crew won fair and square and their prize is that they get to organise next year's Moot.  Very tired Epping Rovers were happy to pass on this honour after a year of planning and hard work.</p>

<h2>An Awesome Moot</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/tassiegroup.jpg" alt="TassieGroup" /></p>
<p>Epping Rovers John, James, Nissa, Jordan, Brook and Oliver at Tassie Moot. Rovers go to Moots - that’s one of the facts in scouting. They are 18 years and older and in TWT territory there are Rover Crews at Epping, Brush Park and Hunters Hill. Other things about Moots like lack of sleep may be just stories rather than facts. You can check this out with your local Rover Crew. Epping Rovers are organising the Sydney North Region’s Summer Moot which is being held in March. As part of their training a number of Epping Rover Crew went to the National Moot held in Tasmania. How was it? According to John Williams “Tassie Moot was an awesome event packed full of adventure and challenges, fun and laughs while meeting so many fantastic people from around Australia and the world. All of these great experiences were made possible through Rovers.”</p>

<h2>Rover's Collect for the Needy</h2>
<p>Rovers from the South Metropolitan Region, Greater Western Sydney Region and our own Sydney North Region have collected around 7,500 food items of food for their annual Hike for Hunger.<br />
The food was delivered to Wesley Mission where it was sorted and packed. Some Rovers hiked with a quantity of the food from Milson's Point across the Harbour Bridge and up to the Mission in Pitt Street.<br />
Brush Park, Epping and Hunters Hill Rovers in TWT territory all collected food so others will have a brighter Christmas.</p>

<h2>Scouts fly at the Roselea School Fete</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/flyingfox04.jpg" alt="FlyingFox" /></p>
<p>Potential Joeys and Cubs lined up all day to experience the thrills of the Flying Fox at the Roselea School Fete held on September 18th.</p>
<p>The 1st Roselea Group decided to run the day both as community service and to raise our profile in our main local feeder school. We used leaflets and stickers from NSW Branch publicity pack (available to all Groups).</p>
<p>As the children lined up for the experience, parents made lots of enquiries regarding Scouting before some of the mums lined up as well. We have 7 families interested in Cubs/Scouts and 10 who may form the core of a new Joey Mob.</p>
<p>Sydney North Region Office lent us their enormous yellow &quot;Scouts&quot; banner and some promotional laminated posters, which we used to identify the area.</p>
<p>It was really a team effort: the Sydney North Flying Fox Team led by David &quot;Chips&quot; Rafferty, a great bunch of Epping Rovers, Cub and Scout Leaders, Cubs and Scouts in uniform and parents all worked hard together to provide around 500 rides on the day.</p>
<p>Cost was a gold coin donation for 2 rides, this was to help with the replacement of ropes, etc. &quot;Cubs and Scouts who turned up in uniform got free rides,&quot; so we had lots of uniformed members at the fete: great publicity!</p>
<p>Set-up was on Friday afternoon and evening, from approximately 4:30 to 10:30pm, then the Rovers had pizza and slept at the school to provide security. Final adjustments, safety checks, harnessing teams instructed at 7:30am and we were up and running by 9:30... hard work but great fun. Finished at 3pm and packed up by 4:30pm. The rovers had been there for 24 hours! Bravo to all!</p>
<p>Overall it was a fantastic day. The food stalls were great as well, especially the Devonshire teas! The School has told us we were very popular and has said we would be welcome back. It was very good for Group morale, great publicity and we gave a lot of children big smiles!</p>
<p>Thanks again to the Flying Fox Team and Epping Rovers.</p>

<h2>Epping Rovers win themselves a job!</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/eppingmoot03(1).jpg" alt="Epping Moot" /></p>
<p>Epping Rovers have won the right to organise next year's Sydney North Region's Moot (a gathering of scouts over 18).</p>
<p>The tradition is that the regional winner of the 'skin' at each Moot takes on the organiser's role the following year.</p>
<p>Held at the Colo River this year under the title 'The Moot Must Be Crazy', about 150 Rovers met and enjoyed themselves for a weekend while competing in such competitions as banana wrestling, a survivor puzzle and a trivia hunt. Con-gratulations Epping Rovers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Part of Epping Rovers winning ways are their support and encouragement to other scouts. On a recent Friday they organised a games night for Venturers, 15 to 17-year-old scouts, from both Epping and Meadow-bank groups. Including competitive games and trust games, everyone had a great time and of course want to continue in their scouting adventures.</p>

<h2>ROVENTURE 2004 - Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</h2>
<p>After a great weekend of fun and excitement a few Venturers and Rovers from around the Region had a few things to say about Roventure 2004. If you or your Venturer Unit didn't make it to Roventure this year, make sure you lookout for Roventure in February 2005.</p>
<p>This year's Roventure saw the Venturers and Rovers of the Region combine take and defeat the killer tomatoes while enjoying everything that 2nd Gordon Rovers and Venturers had to offer!</p>
<p>Camp Kariong was a great location for the weekend, with the water activities a huge success with everyone - especially Mona Vale who were the winners of the water obstacle course event, and Dean Simmat who put the activities to the test.</p>
<p>The events of Saturday morning were an excellent chance for each team's Venturers and Rovers to get to know each other better while completing a variety of round robin activities. Box stacking and raft building only two of many initiative activities that were on offer for each team to do their best and gain points over the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;An Awesome weekend, activities, fun and great food!&quot; - Epping Venturers</p>

<h2>NSW Rovers 2002 Hike for Hunger success!</h2>
<p><img src="ResourcesFolder/BlogImages/hikeforhunger02b.jpg" alt="hikeforhunger02b" /></p>
<p>Over 150 Rovers from all over NSW participated with this years NSW Rovers Annual Service Project, Hike for Hunger, by collecting canned and non-perishable goods for The Wesley Mission, Sydney.</p>
<p>Hike for Hunger is a state-wide project that Rovers actively participate in, in conjunction with the Wesley Mission's Homeless Kids Outreach Program. Rovers had been collecting canned and non-perishable foods from everywhere and anywhere. They were in shopping centres and on the streets, talking to people about the excellent work that The Wesley Mission does for the underprivileged in Sydney, but also the great work that Rovers does in the community, and that they live up to their motto of &quot;Service&quot;.</p>
<p>This years hike took place in Sydney, on Saturday, 19th October, 2002, with Rovers from across the State walking across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and then through Sydney to the offices of The Wesley Mission, where all the food was presented. Over 4,000 cans were collected in all, and it yet again overfilled the cupboards at the centre!!!!!!</p>
<p>This is the fourth year that NSW Rovers have stepped up to the challenge, and participated in the Hike for Hunger project. It aims to promote the awareness of the needs of homeless and underprivileged people in Sydney, in particular youth at risk. It also acts as a way for collecting much needed food for this worthwhile cause.</p>
