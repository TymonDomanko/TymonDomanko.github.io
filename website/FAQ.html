    <h3><a name="what-is-a-rover"></a>What the Hell is a Rover?</h3>
    <p>
        ROVER: n. ~ a male or female homo-sapien between the age of 18 and 26, dedicated to fun and adventure
        while serving the community in the Scouting way.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="what-is-a-rover-crew"></a>What is a Rover Crew?</h3>
    <p>
        A group of Rovers of course! Rovers are people who meet regularly and participate in a wide range of
        challenging and interesting activities, such as rock climbing, white-water kayaking, car touring, and
        bush dancing, whilst learning new skills and making many friends. You can become a Rover when you turn
        17 and you can stay for up to nine years. When you turn 26 you get "booted" from your Rover Crew. Your
        Crew could be as small as 5 or as large as 50 Rovers. All Crews are different and not all Crews may suit
        your needs. You are not obliged to join your local Crew. If there are other Crews nearby, look around before
        you decide which Crew is best for you.
    </p>

    <h3>Organisation of a Rover Crew</h3>
    <p>
        Rover Crews are self-governing. Each Crew elects a team of office bearers to handle its management and
        day-to-day operation. After undertaking the necessary leadership training, one day you could be elected as
        the Crew Leader, giving you responsibility for the Crew and gaining you a Certificate of Adult Leadership.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="traditional-rover-crew"></a>The Traditional Rover Crew</h3>
    <p>
        1st Epping is a Traditional Rover Crew. Just like a Cub Pack's structure is based on the Jungle Book, a
        Traditional Rover Crew is centred on the stories of the Knights of the Round Table. The theme is used in the
        training of Rovers to take their place in the Crew and in society. Although this idea may seem outdated, the
        majority of Crews choose to run this way. There are two stages of investiture in Traditional Crews - when you
        first join you become a Rover Squire, which is a training period before you can become a fully invested Rover,
        sometimes referred to as a Rover Knight. Once you become a fully invested Rover you are truly a member of the
        Crew, and become more involved in its running.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="brief-history"></a>A Brief History of Rovering</h3>
    <p>
Unofficially, Rovering first came to Australia in 1910, in the form of Senior Scouts with the Marrickville Troop
        in Sydney. Officially, Baden-Powell introduced what he called Senior Scouts in Britain in early 1918. The name of
        the section was changed to Rover Scouts later in that same year. In Australia, the first large gathering of Rovers,
        known as a Rover Moot, took place in Victoria in 1927. Rovers changed dramatically in the 1970s when they became
        increasingly self-governing and admitted females into the Movement. Australian membership grew rapidly. In 1980,
        the 8th Australian National Rover Moot was held in Queensland, and was the first National Moot to be run entirely
        by Rovers. Australian Rovers later took a leading role in the reintroduction of World Moots, and this resulted in
        the successful running of the 8th World Moot, held in Victoria in 1990/91. Today there are around 3,500 Rovers
        across all states of Australia.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="rover-council"></a>Rover Councils</h3>
    <h4><a name="RRC"></a>Region Rover Council (R.R.C.)</h4>
    <p>
The Region Rover Council is where representatives from every Crew in that Region attend a meeting to exchange ideas,
        promote events, plan training and public relations activities, and make recommendations to the Branch Rover Council.
The R.R.C. also ensures good communication by maintaining a directory of all the Crews in the Region, and is responsible
        for encouraging the development of new Crews.
    </p>
    <h4><a name="BRC"></a>Branch Rover Council (B.R.C.)</h4>
    <p>
The Branch Rover Council is where representatives from the Region Rover Councils meet to organise the section on a
        state-wide basis, and co-ordinate large scale Rover activities such as Moots and overseas service projects. The B.R.C.
also organises the provision of such valuable items such as Rover car stickers, T-shirts and other promotional material.
The NSW B.R.C. maintains a website which provides a wealth of information about what Rovers in NSW and around the world
        are up to.
    </p>
    <h4><a name="NRC"></a>National Rover Council (N.R.C.)</h4>
    <p>
The National Rover Council functions in a similar way to the Branch Rover Council but is obviously at anAustralia-wide
        level. The ability for the National Council to meet regularly is clearly difficult. Its role is to review and plan the
        development of Rovering in Australia as a whole, as well as to interact with other sections of Scouting and the community.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="service"></a>Service</h3>
    <p>
The other sections of the Movement have "Be Prepared" as their motto. Rovers, however, have their own motto, which
        is simply "Service". Your Rover Crew will endeavour to complete a number of service projects while you are a Rover.
These may be in the form of either service to Scouting, or service to the wider community. As a Rover, you may
        choose to help with a Cub Pack or perhaps you will build a bridge at the local Scout camp. Possible community
        service activities that your Crew might undertake include giving blood, meals on wheels, planting trees, taking
        disabled people out for a day, bush regeneration, Clean Up Australia Day, running camps for disadvantaged or sick
                                                                                                    children, or cleaning local monuments. As a Rover, you will develop a natural talent to find ways of making some of
        the initially most uninteresting activities fun and rewarding. Don't worry, Service is certainly not a chore. It is a
        reminder that as a Rover you are part of the Scout Association and a member of something more than just an outdoors
        club.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="activities"></a>Special Activities</h3>
    <h4><a name="moots"></a>Moots</h4>
    <p>
        When Rover Crews get together for a weekend of crazy and unusual activities, it is called a Moot. You can meet many other
        Rovers from all around the country and the world. There are many varieties of Moots, ranging from local to World Moots.
        Region and Branch Moots are often organised around a theme, and last for a weekend. National and World Moots are run
        similarly to Ventures and last for about 10 days.
    </p>
    <h4><a name="roventure"></a>Roventure</h4>
    <p>
        As a Venturer you will be able to attend one of these fabulous camps where you can. The Roventure is like a Region or Branch
        Rover Moot except that Venturers are invited to come along. This is a great way for you to find out what Rovers are like,
        experience one type of Rover activity, and meet a lot of other Crews other than your local one.
    </p>
    <h4><a name="booting"></a>Booting</h4>
    <p>
        When a Rover reaches the age of 26 it is time to move on to being an old fart! The official term for the occasion when you
        leave Rovers is a Booting. A Booting is usually a farewell party, barbecue or dinner where the Rover Crew wishes you well in
        life and sends you on your way. Sometimes they are held at Branch or National activities where many Rovers are present.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="award-scheme"></a>Award Scheme</h3>
    <h4><a name="BP"></a>Baden-Powell Scout Award</h4>
    <p>
        This is an optional award that some Rovers choose to undertake. It is an individual challenge, where you set your own goals, but
        have them approved by the Crew before you start. Rovers are challenged to reach the highest standard of which they are personally
        capable in four development areas, namely physical, intellectual and emotional, social and spiritual. It generally takes at least
        two years of work to complete the award.
    </p>
    <h4><a name="rover-wood"></a>Rover Wood Badge</h4>
    <p>
        Once the basic and advanced Rover leadership training has been completed (including project), a Rover is awarded the Rover Wood
        Badge. The Scouts Association of Australia is a Registered Training Provider under the Vocational Education and Training Sector (The
        'VET Sector') which is managed by the Commonwealth and State Governments, the advanced training leads to a Certificate IV in Leadership
        Support and a Certificate IV in Business (Frontline Management). Not only that, all Wood Badge recipients become members of the 1st
        Gilwell Scout Group in England, which entitle them to wear the Gilwell Tartan scarf at special times.
